# Heart_attacks
Heart attack classifier, with EDA, few algorithms showcased.

In this project I got dataset about people, that are likely to get heart attack and who aren't. The aim was to maximize recall metric.
Few algorithms were tested, but base algorithm was Logistic Regression .

Possible improvements:
1) Get more data
2) Tune hyperparameters
